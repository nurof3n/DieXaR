This represents my Bachelor's Thesis project. It is a hardware-accelerated Path Tracer, written in DirectX 12 + DXR. The material model is an adaptation of Disney's Principled BSDF. Look into the [Docs](./Docs) folder for the thesis text.
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7kqSKokhC0Mnne8t-Kkr2N61_03Y5T-/view?usp=drive_link) is the demo that was presented to the committee.

**Notice**: this was a 2-week concentrated effort project (the timeframe in which I had to also write the Thesis text), so the code quality may vary. Many improvements are planned to be released for my Master's project, including architectural changes and performance enhancements.
