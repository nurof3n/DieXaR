  abstract  = {Some applications of computer graphics require a vivid illusion of reality. These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

  abstract   = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

Without clarity about the dimensions of realism, we cannot assess how and when to aim for a higher degree of realism, when lower realism suffices, or when purposeful unrealism is ideal for a game and can benefit player experience (PX). To address this conceptual gap, we conducted a systematic review using thematic synthesis to distinguish between types of realism currently found in the digital games literature. We contribute qualitative themes that showcase contradictory design goals of realism/unrealism. From these themes, we created a framework (i.e., a hierarchical taxonomy and mapping) of realism dimensions in digital games as a conceptual foundation. Our themes and framework enable a workable specificity for designing or analyzing types of realism, equip future work to explore effects of specific realism types on PX, and offer a starting point for similar efforts in non-game applications.},

The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets.}

We compare the resulting transmission model to measured data from several real surfaces and discuss appropriate choices for the microfacet distribution and shadowing-masking functions. Since rendering transmission through media requires tracking light that crosses at least two interfaces, good importance sampling is a practical necessity. Therefore, we also describe efficient schemes for sampling the microfacet models and the corresponding probability density functions.},

Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders.

  abstract  = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating the emission and scattering of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting design, architecture, and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include neutron transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms is the high complexity of the geometric, scattering, and illumination models used. In this dissertation, we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range of input models for which light transport simulations are practical. We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms (those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). We propose a new formulation based on linear operators, such that for any physically valid input scene, the transport operators are symmetric. We also show how light transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling method.Our statistical contributions include multiple importance sampling, a new variance reduction technique that can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and combines these samples in a way that is provably close to optimal.Finally, we propose new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms. Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from a sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance sampling, a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently.The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following a random walk through path space, such that the probability density of visiting each path is proportional the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The resulting algorithm is unbiased, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches for difficult lighting problems. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.},
